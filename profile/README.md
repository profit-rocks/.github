## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We participated in informatiCup 2023. The informatiCup is a yearly competition organized by the GI for all students in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The task this year was _Profit_. _Profit_ is a facility layout problem, where given a set of obstacles and ressources, one has to place mines, conveyors and factories, to produce goods. To solve this task we developed a genetic algorithm in Golang.
